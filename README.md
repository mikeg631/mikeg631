This github contains projects that I have worked on during my Computer Science degree and in my own time.

 *Computer Networking
 *Data Structures
 *Design Patterns
 *My own DiscordBot for a personal server
 *A GUI Java DBC
 *Operating Systems
 *Programming Language Concepts
 *My senior project

##Computer Netowrking
This contains a client-server project that allows a contest-miester to create questions for a quiz contest. Users can take the quiz made by the contest-miester
The server was created using Java

##Data Structures
There are two key projects here:
 *A sorting analysis
 *Huffman Encoding
 
##Design Patterns
There are two separate projects here focused on Tex-Mex food. The goal of these projects was to make use of design patterns learned in the class to simulate the creation of food.
 
##JavaJDBC
Here is an assignment that required the use of Java to make a connection with an existing MariaDB database. A GUI (made using swing) is provided to allow for queries on the database.
 
 ##Operating systems
 There are three Major projects included
 *Changing linux process's task struct and adding system calls
 *Adding classifcation levels to Files and adding associated System calls
 *Creating a User space game driver
 
 Additionally a slightly related project which contains my own implementation of malloc and free is included.
 
 ##Programming Language Concepts
 In this I implemented several programming language concepts. Early in the class Antlr 4 was used for parsing and executing code. Later on OCAML was used to parse and execute code.
 As a final assignment, code was compiled and generated using OCAML. This was done by making use of the OCAML verison of LLVM.
 
 Projects include:
 *BC Programming Language implemention in ANTLR4 (no scopes or functions)
 *BC Programming with Scopes and Functions in ANTLR4
 *Polynomial Simplification (OCAML)
 *Reverse Polish Notation Calculator (OCAML)
 *Type inference in Prolog
 *C-Like language using LLVM (OCAML)
 
 ##My Senior Project - A Neurosurgery Patient Anatomy Application
 From my abstract in the pdf report:
 >Neuroimaging has allowed for doctors to diagnose patients and make decisions on treatment. Often patients must make life-altering decisions on treatment options. Due the nature of cancer in the brain, the side effects of a treatment option can vary. Doctors do their best to provide patients with the information they need to make these decisions. CT and MRI scans effectively communicate to medical experts what is going on in the brain, but it is not as clear to the average person.
 
>With all this in mind, we decided to produce a pipeline to segment and visualize a patientâ€™s brain. This visualization can be presented to the patient to better help explain their condition and give them more information to make decisions on treatment options. In this report, we will discuss how set up server to process the brain, used FreeSurfer to segment the brain and used VTK to render it on an iPhone.
