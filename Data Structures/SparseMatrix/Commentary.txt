My matrix is implemented using a linked list that has values for it's columns and rows included. My elements are added in to be sorted by rows into a list. I choose this implementation as it made it possible to keep track of the non-zero values without storing information about the zero values.
The clear, setSize, getNumRows and getNumCols operations are is on O(1). toString(), getElement, removeElement and addElement is all O(n). 
multiplyMatrices is on O(n^3) as there are 3 levels of nested loops needed to calculate and properly place each value in the new matrix. 
addMatrices is on O(n^2) as a double for loop is used to add each elements to the new matrix.
